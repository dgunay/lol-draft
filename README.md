# LoL Draft

Perl program which lets you run a few alternative draft modes from DOTA using
League champions.

Currently requires an internet connection to get the latest list of champions
from.

## Installation

Run `make`, `make test`, and then if it looks good, `make install`.

There are also standalone executables in the Releases page made with PAR::Packer.

I'd like you to make me a program which emulates the drafting modes available for dota 2
but with the league champion pool
even if league doesn't support these modes
custom games are a possibility
yeah I didn't think it'd be too difficult
the 3 modes i'd be looking for are

All-random (no duplicates, 2 rerolls)
Single Draft (all players choose from 3 champions, no duplicates)
Random Draft (Players choose from a fixed pool of 20-30 random champions, no duplicates)

I want it set up in such a way that it can executed outside of game
and then people will just go in with a designated champ and pick that champ
no rush tho
there might even already be an existent community
for this sort of stuff
I might do some digging tonight
anyway since i'm not paying you or anything just make it at your leisure, but give me progress reports when you feel like you've reached certain benchmarks
good luck :thumbsup:
